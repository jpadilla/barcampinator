Barcampinator - A Barcamp tool built on Django.
====================

Introduction
---------------------
On November of last year @gio and I organized the official Barcamp San Juan in Puerto Rico. The first thing we decided to do was a web app where as users came in the door the would register themselves as attending and optionally as presenters. Then we built something on top of that to display in 2 plasma TVs spread around the event.

We built this in a couple of hours before the event, so we found ourselves fixing bugs as they happened right there. We decided we should make this an open source project for those Barcamp hackers and organizers. We feel this is going to help you as it helped us.
